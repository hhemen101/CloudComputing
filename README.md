# AWS Compute Service Info Website 
This project showcases a serverless website that enables users to determine which AWS compute service is best suited for their needs. The website presents the pros and cons of four AWS services, including Lambda, Batch, VMware, and Lightsail. Users will be able to make educated decisions that promote productivity, scalability, and success in the digital sphere.

## Project Overview
- Developed the website's layout and visual design using CSS.
- Built the structure and content using HTML.
- Displays each recommendation with descriptions of what the service has that a user might be looking for, price, risks, advantages, and use cases.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

## Future Work
- Add information about all the other AWS services.
- Add features for users to add filters of what they are looking for, and the website will direct the user to the AWS service that best matches the user's wants.
